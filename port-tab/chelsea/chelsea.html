			<p class="p-news">The quest for points goes on and Jose Mourinho has shone light on the bespoke training given to his championship-winning squad in the week since beating Crystal Palace. Our current 83-point total cannot be beaten and with three games remaining, the Blues boss has his sights set on at least 90 which he considers would be a ‘beautiful number’ from a competition as strong as this one. The maximum possible 92 would be the joint-second highest in Premier League history, only behind our own 95 in Mourinho’s first season.</p>

			<p class="p-news">The fact Jose Mourinho has not won a Barclays Manager of the Month award this season was raised at his pre-match press conference today. This morning it was announced that April’s winner was Nigel Pearson. Last month we beat his Leicester City side and earned more points than them. It is the second time this season Chelsea have accrued more points than the team whose manager won the award. Indeed, in a season in which we have led the way all along, nearly half of the league’s managers have claimed the prize.</p>

			<p class="p-news">Petr Cech says the fact we have clinched the title with three games to spare can help the team to continue to play well in our remaining fixtures. The first of those takes place on Sunday, when Liverpool head to Stamford Bridge for our penultimate home game of the campaign. Cech was at the club in 2004/05 and 2005/06 when, like this time around, we were crowned champions before the season had ended, and he remembers our approach going into those final matches. ‘The fact you are the champions and have nothing to lose, knowing you already have the title in your hand, means you can actually play with more freedom,’ says the Chelsea goalkeeper. ‘If you lose the game you are not happy and of course you want to be happy.</p>

			<p class="p-news">This weekend the most successful team in English football history are expected to form two lines and applaud champions Chelsea onto the field of play. It is traditionally the home side that provides a guard of honour for a newly-crowned visiting side, but the gesture of respect by the Brendan Rodgers and his Liverpool side is not unprecedented.</p>
