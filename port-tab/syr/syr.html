			<h5><a href="http://connect.syracuse.com/staff/mwaters/posts.html">By: Mike Waters</a></h5>

As a sophomore, Christmas started in all 40 of Syracuse's games, setting a school record. Last season, Christmas enjoyed the biggest breakout season for any player in Syracuse history. The 6-foot-9 center led Syracuse with 17.5 points and 9.1 rebounds per game. Those numbers were up from 5.8 points and 5.1 rebounds during his junior year.

			<h3><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/orangebasketball/index.ssf/2015/05/acc_supervisor_of_officials_john_clougherty_announces_his_retirement.html">Official John Clougherty retires</a></h3>
			<h5><a href="http://connect.syracuse.com/staff/mwaters/posts.html">By: Mike Waters</a></h5>
			<p>Syracuse, N.Y. -- John Clougherty, the Atlantic Coast Conference's long-time coordinator of basketball officials, announced that he will retire after the 2015-16 season. Clougherty worked as a college basketball referee for 30 years before becoming the ACC's supervisor of officials in 2005. The ACC announced Clougherty's decision to retire on the conference's website.

			"John Clougherty continues to serve the Atlantic Coast Conference and the sport of college basketball with great integrity and passion," ACC commissioner John Swofford said in the release. "As we look ahead to the upcoming season, we appreciate John's continued dedication and leadership of our men's basketball officiating program."</p>

			<h3><a href="">Matthew Moyer a Top 20 recruit?</a></h3>
			<h5><a href="http://connect.syracuse.com/staff/chriscarlson/index.html">By: Chris Carlson</a></h5>
			<p>When Syracuse assistant Gerry McNamara first spied Matthew Moyer, the Ohio prospect was a hidden gem, a recruit located off the radar of most recruiting analysts whose rankings seemed to indicate he'd grow into a solid player. Since then, Moyer has done nothing but impress, climbing up lists and putting up points. Nearly every recruiting service has elevated him since last summer, with Moyer's current ranking ranging from No. 43 (Rivals) to No. 61 (Scout). One analyst, however, has always viewed Moyer as more of a blue-chip prospect than lunch-pail player. 247 Sports director of basketball recruiting Jerry Meyer currently ranks Moyer as the No. 19 player in the Class of 2016, an area he reserves for projected NBA talent.</p>
